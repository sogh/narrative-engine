# Prompt Log — 2026-02-22

## Entry 1

**Time:** 2026-02-22
**Prompt:** "Yeah start working on the pronoun issue."

**Context:** After running `cargo run --example dinner_party`, the output showed `{possessive}` template references resolving to "Eleanor's", "Robert's" etc. instead of actual pronouns ("her", "his"). The `resolve_pronoun` function in `grammar.rs` was a placeholder that appended `'s` to entity names.

**Work — Pronoun Resolution System (COMPLETE):**
- Added `Pronouns` enum to `src/schema/entity.rs` with variants: `SheHer`, `HeHim`, `TheyThem`, `ItIts`
- Each variant provides methods: `subject()`, `object()`, `possessive()`, `possessive_standalone()`, `reflexive()`
- Added `pronouns: Pronouns` field to `Entity` struct
- Updated `resolve_pronoun()` in `src/core/grammar.rs` to return actual pronoun forms for `{possessive}`
- Updated all 14 entity construction sites across: entity.rs tests, grammar.rs tests, pipeline.rs tests, pipeline_tests.rs, dinner_party.rs (5 entities), jurassic_park.rs (7 entities), preview.rs (dynamic)
- Added `Pronouns` to public re-exports in `lib.rs`
- All 106 tests pass, no warnings
- Verified: dinner party now outputs "her voice", "his drink" instead of "Eleanor's voice", "Robert's drink"
