  - **API Reference** — NarrativeEngine builder methods, narrate/narrate_as/narrate_variants, WorldState, PipelineError
  - **Content Authoring** — Grammar RON format with tag conventions, template syntax reference table, voice RON format with field descriptions, Markov corpora tagging, event mappings
  - **Genre Templates** — Social Drama and Survival Thriller with voice tables and supporting rule listings, Political Intrigue and Exploration placeholders, template blending
  - **Tools** — Grammar linter (checks and exit codes), corpus trainer (n-gram guidance), preview shell (command reference)
  - **End-to-End Examples** — Dinner Party and Jurassic Park walkthroughs with code
  - **Determinism and Seeding** — Reproducibility guarantees, seed selection guidance
  - **Performance** — <1ms target, hot path optimization notes
  - **Extending the Engine** — Custom narrative functions, custom genre templates, voice inheritance with resolution rules, grammar override layering
- All code examples are drawn from actual codebase usage (examples/dinner_party.rs, examples/jurassic_park.rs, genre_data/ RON files)

## Entry 2

**Time:** 2026-02-23
**Prompt:** "Let's change all references to 'Jurassic Park' to be more generic 'Dino Park' so we aren't copyright infringers"

- Updated file contents: doc comment title, run command, removed movie-year seed comment, replaced "Isla Nublar" with "Dino Park", replaced "InGen Security" with "Park Security"
- Updated `Cargo.toml` example target from `jurassic_park` to `dino_park`
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` project structure tree

- Updated `docs/design.md` — all "Jurassic Park" → "Dino Park"
- Updated `docs/narrative_engine_design_doc.md` — all "Jurassic Park" → "Dino Park"
