# Prompt Log — 2026-02-21

## Entry 1

**Time:** 2026-02-21
**Prompt:** "Take a look at the updated CLAUDE.md and then review the to-do folder and begin work."

**Context:** CLAUDE.md has been fully populated with project overview, tech stack, project structure, architecture principles, coding conventions, RON data format conventions, common tasks, and what-not-to-do guidelines. The to-do folder contains `implementation_prompts.md` with 14 sequential prompts (Prompt 0 through Prompt 13). Starting with Prompt 0: Project Scaffolding.

**Work — Prompt 0: Project Scaffolding (COMPLETE):**
- Created `Cargo.toml` with dependencies: `serde` (with derive), `ron` 0.8, `rand` 0.8, `rustc-hash` 2, `thiserror` 2. Binary targets for `corpus_trainer`, `grammar_linter`, `preview`. Example targets for `dinner_party`, `jurassic_park`.
- Created full module hierarchy under `src/`:
  - `lib.rs` — public re-exports of `schema`, `core`, `genre_templates`
  - `schema/` — `entity.rs` (EntityId, VoiceId, Value, Entity), `event.rs` (Mood, Stakes, Outcome, EntityRef, Event), `narrative_fn.rs` (NarrativeFunction enum with 10 core + Custom), `relationship.rs` (Relationship)
  - `core/` — `pipeline.rs` (NarrativeEngine placeholder), `grammar.rs` (GrammarSet, GrammarRule, Alternative), `markov.rs` (MarkovModel placeholder), `voice.rs` (Voice, VoiceRegistry placeholder), `context.rs` (NarrativeContext placeholder), `variety.rs` (VarietyPass placeholder)
  - `genre_templates/` — placeholder modules for social_drama, survival_thriller, political_intrigue, exploration
- Created `tools/` with placeholder binaries for all three tools
- Created `genre_data/` directories for all four genres (with .gitkeep)
- Created `tests/fixtures/test_grammar.ron` (3 rules: greeting, tense_observation, action_detail)
- Created `tests/fixtures/test_corpus.txt` (10 sentences across [neutral], [tense], [warm] tags)
- Created `tests/` integration test files (grammar_tests.rs, markov_tests.rs, pipeline_tests.rs)
- Created `examples/` with placeholder dinner_party.rs and jurassic_park.rs
- Copied design doc to `docs/design.md`
- `cargo build` succeeds, `cargo test` passes all 17 tests (14 unit + 3 integration)

**Next:** Prompt 1 — Schema Layer
