[dread]
The jungle had gone quiet. That was never a good sign.
Something was moving through the underbrush, something large and deliberate.
The fence was supposed to hold. It was designed to hold. It had not held.
In the darkness, eyes reflected the emergency lights and then disappeared.
The ground trembled with footsteps that should not have existed in this epoch.
Every instinct said run. Training said hold position. Neither felt right.
The air carried a scent that was older than memory, something primal and wrong.
Night fell like a curtain, and with it came the sounds they had been dreading.
The compound felt smaller in the dark, the walls thinner, the locks more fragile.
Somewhere in the facility, metal groaned under a weight it was never meant to bear.
What had been a controlled environment was now anything but controlled.

[urgent]
Move. Now. Don't stop. Don't look back.
The breach alarm screamed through the corridors, red lights strobing in the fog.
Two minutes to lockdown. They needed five.
The vehicle wouldn't start. Fuel line compromised. They were running.
Static burst from the radio followed by a single word: evacuate.
Power grid failure in sectors three through seven. Backup failing.
The extraction point was two kilometers through compromised territory.
Every route was blocked. Every alternative was worse.
Containment had failed. The only question now was how badly.
They had seconds, not minutes. Act accordingly.

The morning mist clung to the paddock fences, peaceful and unremarkable.
Systems nominal. Coffee hot. Another routine day in paradise.
The compound hummed with the quiet efficiency of a well-run operation.
Sunlight filtered through the canopy, dappling the path with gold and green.
The animals were feeding. The tourists were smiling. Everything was fine.
A perfect day, the kind that makes you forget what you are keeping behind electric fences.
The generators ran their cycle, a steady mechanical heartbeat beneath the birdsong.
All indicators green. All containment protocols active. All personnel accounted for.
The island was beautiful. That was the problem. Beauty breeds complacency.

[technical]
Fence voltage dropped below containment threshold at zero two forty-seven hours.
Lysine contingency inactive. Breeding population confirmed in restricted sectors.
Thermal signatures detected beyond perimeter grid, quadrant seven-alpha.
Seismic monitors registered anomalous activity consistent with large-fauna locomotion.
Automated feeding systems offline. Manual override required for paddocks nine through twelve.
Backup power capacity at thirty-one percent. Estimated depletion in four point seven hours.
Communications relay damaged. Long-range transmission capability compromised.
Motion tracking shows coordinated movement patterns suggesting pack behavior.
Structural analysis indicates east fence section weakened by corrosion and impact damage.
Environmental controls failing. Temperature regulation offline in laboratory wing.
